Welcome to goodcar-ma

When prompted to our home page, you will be welcomed with a welcomed page
and asked to get started in advertising your car. You will begin with filling out basic information, 
your first and last name, age, phone number, email and your choice between a car or a 
motorcycle. Based on your choice of a car or a motorcycle you will be prompted to 
the correct vehicle page, and you will fill out all the options of the car or motorcycle.
If the car option was selected then after the user fills out the form they will
be prompted to an additional page to chose more options for their car. If a motorcycle was chosen
then the user will not be prompted to the additional page. After the user fills out all required
information then all the data will be displayed on the summary page based on which option was chosen of car or motorcycle.
All user data is stored in a database and is then displayed on the home page after all forms have been filled out. 

All data is created through the classes using parent/child relationships. All routing and validation
is controlled through the controller.php and is guided through the composer.json and through the index page.
